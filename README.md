Scenario : Your team has been asked by COMSC to develop a stand-alone package that provides visitors with a multiple choice quiz at Engagement events.  

The School of Computer Science & Informatics requires an application that allows people to undertake an interactive quiz.  Your prototype should consist of a quiz containing 10 multiple choice questions that can include pictures as well as just words. The quiz should be self-explanatory and simple to use by all. The system should provide immediate feedback after each individual quiz question.  It is very important that the quiz can cope with visitors answering just one, some or all the questions. Each visitor must be able to select to restart the quiz and if the visitor completed the entire quiz they should at the end be presented with a summary of their performance.  The COMSC engagement team should be ability to add new and delete current questions.

The scenario above provides you with the basic requirements however you will be expected to provide some additional features.
